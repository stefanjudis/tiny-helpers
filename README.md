## Contributing

Make sure you have a recent version of [Node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en/) (we recommend at least version `v12.14.`). After installing Node.js you'll have the `node` but also the [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) command available. npm is Node.js' package manager.

**Additionally, please have a look at the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) including further information about what counts as a tiny helper.**
